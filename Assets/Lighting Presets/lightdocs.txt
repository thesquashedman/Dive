Lighting system can now specifically render hard shadows on a seperate layer so that they can be combined onto the main layer.
This makes it possible to render both hard shadows (non see through shadows) and softer shadows (see through shadows) from the same light.

Important things necessary for the lighting system to work. Only necessary for levels where we need a light to be able to make different kinds of shadows	

1. There must be two cameras. 
One (Main render camera) renders everything except things on the shadow layer. 
The other (Hard shadow camera) renders everything on the shadow layer
and renders it to the "Hard Shadow Render" Render texture. 
Main render camera must use RendererAllEffects as the renderer to apply the hard shadows. 
Hard shadow camera must use RenderNoPost as the renderer so that it doesn't apply any post processing to the texture it renders to.

2. The background must be sperated onto two layers. The main background is on the default layer, and can have whatever we want on it.
The second will be on the shadow layer, and should be entirely white.

3. Every light must be made up of two lights. The lights should be the same save for two differences
a. The layers (default vs shadow)
b. The target layers (default vs HardShadow)
Note: If a light doesn't cast multiple shadow types, we still need two lights for it, since if there is no light affecting the hard shadow layer
that area will be treated as being fully in shadow. 

4. On the shadowcasters, if they should be affected by the HardShadowLight their target layer should be Hardshadow, otherwise their target layer is default
