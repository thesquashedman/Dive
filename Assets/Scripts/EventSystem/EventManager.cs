/*
Written by Justin.
Class is meant to hold and notify subscribers when events happen 
for the game. 

To use: add a static event variable, with a corresponding method
that invokes the event when necessary. 

In another class, on Start()
subscribe that class to an event, register a method, and also create
an OnDisable() in case of deletion that unsubscribes the event.

Each event can have any number of subscriptions attached to it.

Then, wherever else call the event method, this will trigger the event
for all classes subscribed to the specific event.
